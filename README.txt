Assignment 1

All aspects of this assignment are now working. The only issue I ran into
had to do with my github repository. I originally named it incorrectly, so
I had to rename it in order for my website to show up at
dberma02@github.io . Thus, I do not have as many commits as I originally
did because I created this repo when the assignment was mostly complete.

I recieved help from the TA staff.

I spent approximately 8 hours on this assignment.
